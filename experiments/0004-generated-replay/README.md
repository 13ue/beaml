# EXPERIMENT 0004 — Generated REPLAY RUN

**[Requirement]** Can the BEAML compiler generate the flow, the HTTP EFFECT, the decode, the CAPTURE and the REPLAY RUN runner from one BEAML source, so that the host writes no replay code and no transport? Does the generated arm do more than a shared Elixir replay library with a hand-written descriptor? The section [Owner decisions (2026-11-06)](#owner-decisions-2026-11-06) is the authority. It overrides older plan text.

**[Verified]** [EXPERIMENT 0003](../0003-source-linked-replay/README.md#gate-status) passed with a hand-written runner, [`OrdersApi.Replay.run/3`](../0002-http-correlation/apps/orders_api/lib/orders_api/replay.ex), and a hand-written CAPTURE, `capture/3` in [`payment_http.ex`](../0002-http-correlation/apps/orders_api/lib/orders_api/payment_http.ex). The host [router](../0002-http-correlation/apps/orders_api/lib/orders_api/router.ex) owns the order prepare → `authorize/2` → finish. The [0001 compiler](../0001-syntax-to-beam/src/main.rs) parses `interface`, `enum` and `fn` only. Its interfaces are structural and exact.

**[Verified]** The 0003 live tests check the 0002 trace contract in [`query.py`](../0002-http-correlation/query.py): spans `orders.request`, `orders.prepare`, `orders.payment_http`, `orders.finish` and the log `payment_request_prepared`. `ProbeSupport.span/5` sets `outcome: "error"` only when the wrapped function raises.

**[Proposal]** Hypothesis: with the flow, the EFFECT and its failure type in BEAML, a BEAML-only TYPE change (DRIFT) needs fewer manual change sites in the generated arm (GEN) than in the library arm (LIB). GEN also catches a DRIFT that LIB misses.

## Plan history

- **Revision 1.** Generated runner next to a host flow. Plan review: BLOCK (1 critical, 2 high). [plan-review.md](workflow/2026-11-06/plan-review.md)
- **Revision 2.** LIB arm first as a kill switch, typed record fields, DRIFT R/N/Q, pass and reject rule, three syntax options (A, B, C) with owner questions Q1–Q5.
- **Revision 3.** The owner chose option B with `effect`, `!` and `|>`, a generated decode, no kill switch and LIB in parallel. Q1, Q2 and Q5 are answered. Syntax options A and C are closed; [syntax-options.beaml](syntax-options.beaml) stays as history. Use git history for the full revision 2 text. Plan review: BLOCK (1 critical, 2 high).
- **Revision 4 (this page).** Repairs the three objections of the revision 3 review: one strongest LIB form, frozen before any GEN result is judged; a complete 0003 change table, checked by a diff test on test copies; asserted TYPE mismatch cases, live and in a REPLAY RUN. [Disposition](workflow/2026-11-06/plan-review.md#disposition-main-agent-2026-11-06-1).

## Slice 1 scope

- **In [Requirement].** `effect` declarations with `http.post`. One `!` failure type. Pipe `|>` that passes a failure on, with the compile check against the `!` list. A decode generated from the declared TYPE. A generated `record` (CAPTURE) and a generated REPLAY RUN runner. The flow `place` in BEAML. The router calls only generated code.
- **Later [Requirement] (slice 2+).** `with ... else`, the Elixir `name`/`name!` pair, the formatter alignment rule, other EFFECT kinds (db, queue, mail), a second EFFECT, the old-record policy (Q4), the artifact check in the runner (Q3).

## Slice 1 BEAML source (orders)

**[Proposal]** The fixture `orders.beaml` for GEN. The syntax follows the owner example [order-flow.beaml](examples/order-flow.beaml). `payments.beaml` stays unchanged.

```beaml
interface Order { order_id: String }
interface Payment { order_id: String status: String }
interface PaymentError { reason: String }

// Leaves the module. Recorded live, substituted in a REPLAY RUN.
effect payments.authorize Order -> Payment ! PaymentError = http.post("payments/authorize")

fn prepare Order { order_id } -> Order = Order { order_id: order_id + "" }
fn finish Payment { order_id, status } -> Payment = Payment { order_id: order_id + "", status: status }

// The flow lives in BEAML. A failed step stops the pipe and passes PaymentError on.
fn place order: Order -> Payment ! PaymentError =
  order
  |> prepare
  |> payments.authorize
  |> finish
```

**[Proposal]** Generated Elixir, in the one module that 0002 `run.py` renames to `OrdersBeamlSpike`:

- `prepare/1`, `finish/1` as today. `place/1` returns `{:ok, payment}` or `{:error, %OrdersBeamlSpike.PaymentError{reason: r}}`. The `place!/1` half of the pair is slice 2.
- `payments_authorize/1`: the HTTP EFFECT. POST to `/payments/authorize` on `127.0.0.1` and the port from `ProbeSupport.config(:payments_port)`. Trace context injection, `ProbeSupport.increment/0`, Content-Length framing as in 0002. Then `Replay.record/3` with the actual status (revision 4: the record comes before the status check). Then status 200 only, then the typed decode.
- Typed decode of `Payment`: `:json.decode/1`, then an exact key set with String values. A missing key, an extra key or a non-String value gives `reason: "decode"` (revision 4 [Proposal]: an extra key is a reject, see case (d2)). Transport failure gives `reason: "transport"`, another status gives `reason: "status"`.
- Spans through `ProbeSupport.span/5`: `orders.prepare`, `orders.payments.authorize` (client), `orders.finish`. A failure raises inside the span and becomes `{:error, ...}` outside it, so `outcome: "error"` stays. A failed step stops the pipe: no later step and no later span runs.
- One Orders log, revision 4 [Proposal]: inside the span of the pure step directly before an EFFECT, the generated code calls `ProbeSupport.event("<output TYPE, lower case>_request_prepared", "<step>")`. For `place` this is the existing `payment_request_prepared` under `orders.prepare`. So the 0002 `LOGS` contract and the log counts stay unchanged.
- `Replay.record/3` writes the 0003 RESPONSE RECORD format version 1 to `ProbeSupport.Capture.write/2`. `Replay.run/3` takes `(order, trace_id, records)`. It runs `place` with the EFFECT step replaced by the record checks, then the same typed decode and `finish`. It returns `{:ok, payment}`, one of the six 0003 atoms, or `{:error, %PaymentError{}}`.

## Fixed inputs and ownership

- **LANGUAGE/COMPILATION.** The 0001 compiler gets `effect`, `!`, `|>` and the emit above. One invocation, one stdout. `payments.beaml` output stays byte-identical.
- **EXECUTION.** Reuse the two 0002 releases, the ports, the HTTP path, RESPONSE RECORD format version 1 and `ProbeSupport` (unchanged SHA-256). The router keeps `orders.request`, `valid_order!/1`, `valid_payment!/2` and the reply. It calls `OrdersBeamlSpike.place/1` and nothing else of the flow.
- **EXECUTION.** Each arm is an overlay, applied by `0004/run.py` to a temporary tree with the repository layout: `experiments/0001-syntax-to-beam` (current compiler), `experiments/0002-http-correlation` (copy plus overlay) and `experiments/0003-source-linked-replay` (`run.py` and copies of `tests/*.py`). The path constants of the copies (`EXPERIMENT`, `REPO`, `HTTP`, `COMPILER`) then need no edit. The overlay holds the edited copies of `query.py` and the 0003 tests. `0003/run.py` runs unchanged in that tree.
- **EXECUTION, control.** The 0002 tree, `0003/run.py` and the original 0003 tests stay unchanged in the repository. They run at their default root as the control. An arm run does not change their SHA-256 values.
- **R&D process.** Follow [implement-step](../../skills/implement-step/SKILL.md). Devil's Advocate at the plan, the RED review and the final review, in the gate ledger only.

## Comparison arm LIB

**[Requirement]** No kill switch. LIB is built in parallel with GEN, as the comparison.

**[Proposal] Revision 4: LIB is the strongest fair library.** The plan fixes its form. The LIB worker does not choose a weaker form.

- **Descriptor.** One Elixir map per EFFECT: operation, attempt, expected status, request function (`&OrdersBeamlSpike.prepare/1`), decode function, finish function. No request or response key list, no field name, no other TYPE fact. Budget: about 10 lines.
- **Whole values.** `ReplayLib.record(descriptor, request, status, bytes)` records the whole request value and the whole body bytes. `run` compares the whole recorded request with the request function result (`request_mismatch`), as 0003 does.
- **Typed rescue (mandatory).** `ReplayLib.run(descriptor, order, trace_id, records)` wraps decode and finish in one `rescue`. It returns `{:error, %ReplayLib.Error{step: "decode" | "finish", reason: <exception module name>}}`, never a raise. The six 0003 atoms and their check order stay. Budget: maximum 60 lines.
- **Live path.** The 0002 router, transport and `payment_request_prepared` log stay. The CAPTURE body in `payment_http.ex` becomes one `ReplayLib.record` call. `replay.ex` is deleted.
- **Fairness.** A fresh worker writes LIB without access to the GEN emitter, the 0004 BEAML fixture or any GEN result. LIB may call the public generated `prepare` and `finish`. It may not read BEAML source or metadata that 0004 adds to the generated module.
- **Freeze.** LIB passes (e) before any GEN result of (d2) or (f) is judged. `0004/run.py` records the SHA-256 of `replay_lib.ex` and the descriptor. DRIFT (f) runs only against that frozen LIB. A repair of LIB after the freeze counts as manual change sites.
- **No weak form.** The plan builds no LIB with a key list or without the `rescue`. The pass and reject rule uses only this LIB.
- **[Inference]** This LIB has no stale descriptor. It probably gives a typed reject for an old record after DRIFT-R and DRIFT-N, and `request_mismatch` after DRIFT-Q. Then the reject rule may apply. That is a valid result of slice 1.

## Slice 1: acceptance cases in order

1. **(a) Parse and check.** The compiler accepts the slice 1 source above, exit 0. Each bad declaration fails with exit ≠ 0, a clear message and no stdout:
   - unknown fn in a pipe (`|> charge`);
   - TYPE mismatch in a pipe (`|> finish` directly after `|> prepare`: `Order` is not `Payment`);
   - undeclared failure in a pipe (`place` without `! PaymentError`); the message names the step `payments.authorize` and the type `PaymentError`;
   - field not in TYPE (`finish` reads `amount`, which `Payment` does not have);
   - unsupported EFFECT kind (`db.get`) in slice 1.
2. **(b) Emit.** One compiler run writes the Elixir module with `place/1`, `payments_authorize/1`, the typed decode, `Replay.record/3` and `Replay.run/3`, the `PaymentError` struct and one `beaml-declaration-v1` comment per declaration. The module compiles with warnings as errors. Template control: compile DRIFT-R; the generated decode must contain `reference`. The 0003 gate 1 test `payments_cli_emits_checked_authorize_reference` still passes.
3. **(c) Live.** The GEN router calls only `OrdersBeamlSpike.place/1`. `payment_http.ex` and `replay.ex` are deleted. `0003/run.py` passes in the GEN tree, all five default steps (compiler reference, trace lookup, trace lookup repair, response capture, replay run). The test `tests/overlay_diff_test.py` passes first: per arm, the line diff of each copy against its original equals `arms/<arm>/assertion-changes.json`, which equals the table below. No other line changes.
4. **(d) Replay.** The 0003 8-case matrix passes against `OrdersBeamlSpike.Replay.run/3`: valid, A1 non-canonical, missing, operation, attempt, request, status, digest. Expected values stay as in 0003. Router, transport and `:gen_tcp.connect/4` count zero in all 8 cases. Live and replay use the same generated decode.
5. **(d2) TYPE mismatch, live and in a REPLAY RUN [Requirement].** In `tests/arms_test.py`, not in the 0003 copies. Replay cases use the 0003 harness with the arm's runner. Live cases use one Orders release against the 0003 loopback stub (`http.server`, Content-Length framing). Cases R1, R2, L1, L2, P1 below.
6. **(e) LIB.** The LIB form above passes the same 8 cases with the same counts, in the LIB tree, with the LIB rows of the table only. It then runs R1, R2, L1, L2; the outcomes are recorded, not asserted. Then the freeze.
7. **(f) DRIFT.** Starts after the freeze. Per arm, change only BEAML TYPES or signatures; do not touch the LIB descriptor or host replay code. Regenerate and rebuild. Derivatives:
   - **DRIFT-R.** Add `reference: String` to `Payment` in both BEAML files.
   - **DRIFT-N.** Rename the `Payment` field `status` to `state` in both BEAML files.
   - **DRIFT-Q.** Add a field with a literal value to the request TYPE that `prepare` returns, and the matching Payments input.
   For each derivative and arm, record the outcome at build, on a new live record and on the pre-change record. Outcome classes: compile error with a clear message, typed reject, correct accept, false reject, wrong accept, crash without a typed reason. Then repair each arm until (d) or (e) passes again. Count manual change sites per arm.

### Case (d2): TYPE mismatch cases

**[Proposal]** Each case asserts the result, the counts and, live, the spans and records. "finish 0" is the runtime half of the pipe rule: a failed step stops the pipe.

- **R1 Replay, missing key.** Record of the first live call with body `{"order_id":"order-1"}`, `body_length` and `body_sha256` recomputed, status 200. Expect `{:error, %OrdersBeamlSpike.PaymentError{reason: "decode"}}`, `:json.decode/1` 1, `finish/1` 0, `valid_payment!/2` 0, transport 0.
- **R2 Replay, extra key.** The RESPONSE RECORD from L1. Expect the same result and counts as R1. Live and replay give the same typed error from the same decode.
- **L1 Live, extra key [Proposal: reject].** The stub returns 200 with `{"order_id":"order-1","status":"authorized","extra":"x"}`. Expect HTTP 502 `downstream_failure`, client span `orders.payments.authorize` with `outcome: "error"`, one RESPONSE RECORD with status 200 and these bytes, no `orders.finish` span, transport count 1.
- **L2 Live, status 503.** The stub returns 503 with a valid `Payment` body. Expect HTTP 502, client span `outcome: "error"`, one RESPONSE RECORD with status 503, no `orders.finish` span, transport count 1.
- **P1 Pipe stop.** In an eval VM (0003 harness), `OrdersBeamlSpike.place/1` with a refused port. Expect `{:error, %OrdersBeamlSpike.PaymentError{reason: "transport"}}`, `prepare/1` 1, `finish/1` 0.

**[Unknown]** A recorded live 503 replays as the 0003 `status_mismatch` atom, not as `PaymentError{reason: "status"}`. The 0003 matrix keeps this. Slice 2 can revisit it with D001.

### 0003 lines that change in the arm copies

**[Proposal]** Each GEN change follows from "the router calls only generated code". The copies live in the overlay; the originals stay the control. `overlay_diff_test.py` compares each copy line by line with its original and requires the result to equal this table. Line numbers refer to the original files at the plan commit.

| Arm | File | Line | Original | Copy | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GEN | 0002 `query.py` | 12 | `CONTRACT` key `orders.payment_http` | `orders.payments.authorize` | Generated span name `<service>.<step>` |
| GEN | 0002 `query.py` | 13 | parent of `payments.request`: `orders.payment_http` | `orders.payments.authorize` | Same rename |
| GEN | 0003 `response_capture_test.py` | 175 | client span filter `orders.payment_http` | `orders.payments.authorize` | Same rename |
| GEN | 0003 `response_capture_test.py` | 213 | observer control span `orders.payment_http` (twice) | `orders.payments.authorize` | Same rename; `outcome: "error"` stays |
| GEN | 0003 `replay_run_test.py` | 32 | `WATCHED` key `OrdersApi.PaymentHttp.authorize/2` | `OrdersBeamlSpike.payments_authorize/1` | The transport is generated |
| GEN | 0003 `replay_run_test.py` | 48 | `HARNESS` watched `{OrdersApi.PaymentHttp, :authorize, 2}` | `{OrdersBeamlSpike, :payments_authorize, 1}` | Same |
| GEN | 0003 `replay_run_test.py` | 56 | `HARNESS` control `OrdersApi.PaymentHttp.authorize(prepare(order), [])` | `OrdersBeamlSpike.payments_authorize(prepare(order))` | Same |
| GEN | 0003 `replay_run_test.py` | 57 | `HARNESS` replay `OrdersApi.Replay.run(order, trace_id, responses)` | `with {:ok, p} <- OrdersBeamlSpike.Replay.run(ProbeSupport.valid_order!(order), ...), do: {:ok, ProbeSupport.valid_payment!(p, order)}` | Domain validation stays host code, as in the router |
| GEN | 0003 `replay_run_test.py` | 292 | control result `{"raised": "MatchError"}` | `{"error": "%OrdersBeamlSpike.PaymentError{reason: \"transport\"}"}` | The EFFECT returns a typed failure; counts stay |
| GEN | 0003 `replay_run_test.py` | 293 | control key `OrdersApi.PaymentHttp.authorize/2` | `OrdersBeamlSpike.payments_authorize/1` | Same as line 32 |
| GEN | 0003 `replay_run_test.py` | 301 | `isolated` key `OrdersApi.PaymentHttp.authorize/2` | `OrdersBeamlSpike.payments_authorize/1` | Same as line 32 |
| LIB | 0003 `replay_run_test.py` | 57 | `HARNESS` replay `OrdersApi.Replay.run(order, trace_id, responses)` | `with {:ok, p} <- ReplayLib.run(OrdersApi.ReplayDescriptor.authorize(), ProbeSupport.valid_order!(order), ...), do: {:ok, ProbeSupport.valid_payment!(p, order)}` | `replay.ex` is deleted; same host validation as GEN |

**[Proposal]** Unchanged in both arms, because the Orders log stays (line text **[Verified]** at the plan commit): `query.py` line 17 (`LOGS`), `trace_lookup_test.py` line 175 (`len(checked["logs"]) == 2 * call`) and line 184 (`"logs": 4`). `trace_lookup_repair_test.py` and `run_test.py` have no changed line. The comment lines 38–39 of `replay_run_test.py` stay as history.

**[Inference]** If GEN cannot emit the log, lines 17, 175 and 184 change. That is a table change: it needs a new plan revision, and the verdict records "no Orders log" as a lost check.

All counts in the 8-case matrix stay as in 0003. The revision 2 SHA-256 check of `router.ex` is removed: the router changes by owner decision.

### Replay lines and manual change sites

- **Replay line.** A host line that exists only for replay: CAPTURE, the `record` call, hook wiring, the runner call site, caller-side validation or artifact checks, the LIB descriptor and library. Count them in both arms. Generated and compiler lines are not host lines; report compiler size as a one-time cost.
- **Manual change site.** One contiguous edited hunk in a hand-written file that an arm needs to pass (d) or (e) after a DRIFT. Exclude the BEAML DRIFT edit. Count domain validation edits (`valid_payment!/2`) and test expectation edits apart; they are equal in both arms.

### Pass and reject rule

- **Comparison arm [Proposal].** Judge every clause below only against the frozen LIB of [Comparison arm LIB](#comparison-arm-lib). No other LIB form enters the verdict.
- **Pass [Proposal].** The language claim holds for slice 1 only if both are true: (1) summed over the DRIFT derivatives, GEN needs fewer manual change sites than LIB; (2) for at least one derivative, GEN gives a compile error, a typed reject or a correct accept, while LIB gives a wrong accept or a crash without a typed reason. GEN has no wrong accept in any derivative.
- **Reject [Proposal].** Reject the claim for this slice if LIB needs the same number or fewer manual change sites, if LIB misses no DRIFT that GEN catches, or if GEN gives a wrong accept. Record the reject in the register.
- **Miss [Requirement].** A crash without a typed reason counts as a missed DRIFT (owner decision).
- **No verdict.** If GEN fails (a)–(d2), or LIB fails (e) or is not frozen before (f), slice 1 fails as an implementation and gives no verdict on the claim.

## Decisions (Decision4)

| Decision | Class | Choice and reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Failure TYPE as an interface `PaymentError { reason: String }` with the values `transport`, `status`, `decode` | Repair | The smallest typed struct with a named field. No enum payload rules needed. Q6 can replace it |
| `place/1` returns `{:ok, v}` or `{:error, struct}` only | Repair | It is the `name/n` half of the owner pair; `name!/n` is slice 2 and adds, not changes |
| Generated span names `<service>.<step>` | Repair | Derived, not a literal from 0002. Commits us to the listed assertion changes |
| Keep `payment_request_prepared`: emit `<output TYPE>_request_prepared` in the span of the pure step before an EFFECT (revision 4) | Undo | A local emit rule with no new syntax. Keeps the 0002 `LOGS` contract and the log counts. A BEAML log statement can replace it later |
| Generated code calls `ProbeSupport` for spans, counter, config and CAPTURE store | Repair | The existing 0002 adapter, unchanged. A language runtime contract replaces it later |
| Target from `<namespace>_port` config, host `127.0.0.1` | Repair | Matches 0002 configuration. Real addressing waits for Q7 |
| Transport with `:gen_tcp` and 0002 framing | Repair | Keeps the `:gen_tcp.connect/4` and transport counters of the 0003 observer |
| Host keeps `valid_order!/1` and `valid_payment!/2`; harness calls them around `Replay.run/3` | Repair | Domain validation is host code; keeps the 0003 counts |
| Replay evidence errors stay the six 0003 atoms; flow failures are `PaymentError` | Repair | Keeps the 0003 matrix unchanged. Revisit with D001 |
| Copies of the 0003 tests and `query.py` in the overlay, in a temporary tree with the repository layout; diff checked against the table (revision 4) | Undo | Originals stay the control; no arm switch in the 0003 files; no path edits in the copies |
| Typed decode rejects an extra key (exact key set) (revision 4) | Repair | Matches the exact 0001 interfaces and the generated `finish` pattern. Relaxing it later is one emit change |
| `Replay.record/3` before the status check; the record holds the actual status (revision 4) | Repair | Case L2 needs one record for a 503. The 0003 matrix still expects status 200 in a valid record |
| LIB form fixed: no key list, mandatory typed `rescue`, frozen before (d2) and (f) are judged; no weak LIB (revision 4) | Repair | The verdict must not depend on a free choice of the LIB worker |
| LIB error shape `%ReplayLib.Error{step, reason}` (revision 4) | Undo | Local to the LIB arm; any typed shape counts |
| Elixir name `payments_authorize/1`, nested `Replay` and `PaymentError` modules | Undo | Local naming inside one generated module |
| Reject non-`http` EFFECT kinds at compile time in slice 1 | Undo | Keeps the slice boundary visible; slice 2 removes the reject |
| LIB worker runs in parallel with GEN, in its own directory; tests serialized | Undo | Owner decision overrides the one-writer rule; no shared build output |
| `http.post("payments/authorize")` as the slice 1 call form | Migrate | Taken from the owner example; source files depend on it. Q7 confirms |

**[Verified]** No decision is Answer: 0004 publishes nothing and makes no external claim.

### Owner questions

- **Q1, Q2, Q5.** Answered by the owner decisions: option B with `effect` and `|>`; BEAML owns the decode; a crash without a typed reason is a miss.
- **Q3. Artifact check (slice 2).** (i) The generated runner rejects a record with another `artifact_id` (`artifact_mismatch`). (ii) The caller keeps the check; it counts as replay lines. Slice 1 uses (ii). Depends on [D002](../../wiki/planning/decisions-to-be-made.md#d002--scope-of-the-replay-artifact-identity).
- **Q4. Old record after a SCHEMA change (slice 2).** (i) Typed reject from a SCHEMA version in the record. (ii) Typed reject from `artifact_id` (needs Q3 (i)). (iii) The generated decode rejects it with `PaymentError` (slice 1 behavior).
- **Q6. Shape of an EFFECT failure TYPE (Migrate, before slice 2).** (i) User-declared interface with `reason: String` (slice 1 default). (ii) User-declared `enum` with fixed variant names per EFFECT kind, for example `Transport`, `Status`, `Decode`. (iii) A built-in `HttpError` TYPE that the user names after `!`.
- **Q7. HTTP call form and target (Migrate, before slice 2).** (i) `http.post("payments/authorize")` with the target from configuration by namespace (slice 1 default). (ii) A named target declaration in BEAML, for example `target payments = env("PAYMENTS_URL")`. (iii) Another form from the owner.

## Evidence and limits

**[Unknown]** No run exists. This page is a plan.

**[Inference]** DRIFT-R and DRIFT-N need a `valid_payment!/2` edit in both arms. It counts apart, not as a replay site.

**[Unknown]** Limits carried from 0003: the body digest is integrity, not tamper protection (R2). The RESPONSE RECORD has no timestamp (D003). The check order of the six reasons is not tested. Two records for one trace give `missing_response` without a test.

**[Unknown]** One EFFECT and three DRIFT derivatives are a small sample. A pass shows an advantage for this slice only.

**[Inference]** Revision 4: an extra key is a reject, so a Payments service that adds a field breaks a live Orders call until Orders regenerates. Case L1 makes this visible; it is not a compatibility policy.

**[Unknown]** Revision 4: the generated client span and `Replay.record/3` in an eval VM without the OpenTelemetry application (case P1 and the observer control) are not tested yet. RED shows whether the harness needs a change; such a change is a table change.

### Out of scope

- Everything in "Later" above.
- Retries, attempts > 1, timeouts, uncertain outcomes (round 3, objection 3).
- A REPLAY CAPSULE format, durable storage, trace sampling (D003).
- Zed/LSP support for the new syntax.
- A BAML comparison and the operator-time value gate. [BAML v1](../../wiki/sources/baml-v1.md#observability) has no replay on its default branch at the pin.

**[Proposal]** Smallest next test after slice 1: a second EFFECT in both arms, with change sites counted the same way.

## Owner decisions (2026-11-06)

- **[Requirement]** BEAML owns the call order. Syntax option B: the flow `place` is written in BEAML. The host router only calls generated code.
- **[Requirement]** BEAML makes the HTTP call itself. No hand-written host transport.
- **[Requirement]** BEAML generates the response decode from the declared type. A response that does not match the type gives a typed error, live and in a REPLAY RUN.
- **[Requirement]** In the comparison, a runtime crash without a typed reason counts as a missed DRIFT.
- **[Requirement]** No kill switch. Start the generated arm directly. Build the library arm in parallel as the comparison.
- **[Requirement]** Long-term direction: applications are written in BEAML. Only a pure interface layer (for example LiveView) stays in Elixir and uses generated event handlers.
- **[Proposal]** Main agent: the generated HTTP code may use a socket or an HTTP library inside. The 0003 live tests run again against the changed router.
- **[Unknown]** Open: the BEAML syntax of the HTTP call itself.
- **[Requirement]** BEAML has a pipe operator `|>`. The flow `place` uses it instead of nested calls.
- **[Requirement]** Formatter rule: consecutive `effect` lines (no blank line between them) align three columns: the input type after the longest name, `->` after the longest input type, `=` after the longest output type. A blank line starts a new block.
- **[Proposal]** `effect` marks every call that leaves the function: HTTP, other apps (also over BEAM messages), database, queue, file, time, randomness. Every `effect` result is recorded; a REPLAY RUN substitutes it. The keyword name is still open.
- **[Requirement]** BEAML allows `with ... do ... else ... end`. `<-` binds the success value of a step that can fail; `=` binds a pure step.
- **[Requirement]** An `effect` or `fn` declares its failure type with `!` after the success type, for example `String -> Order ! LoadError`. `<-` binds only the success type. A failure goes to `else`.
- **[Requirement]** The compiler collects the failure types of all `<-` steps. The `else` branch must cover each of them, or compilation fails.
- **[Requirement]** A function may pass failures on with `!` in its own signature, for example `-> Payment ! LoadError | StockError | PaymentError`.
- **[Requirement]** A pipe step may fail. The pipe stops and passes the failure on. The compiler rejects a pipe step whose failure type is not in the `!` list of the enclosing function, with a message that names the step and the missing type.
- **[Requirement]** `!` in a type stays, although Elixir uses `!` in names for "raises". The owner accepts this.
- **[Requirement]** For each BEAML function that can fail, the Elixir output has two functions: `name/n` returns `{:ok, value}` or `{:error, error}`; `name!/n` returns the value or raises an exception generated from the failure type.
- **[Requirement]** Generated Elixir errors are typed structs with named fields, for example `%Orders.LoadError.NotFound{id: "order-1"}`. Not plain tuples.
- **[Requirement]** Generated decode is strict by default: an unknown key in a response is a typed error. A later explicit opt-in for tolerant decode stays open.
